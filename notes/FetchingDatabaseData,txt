# There is no need to configure your model, everything is on the Model Class

# If you want to change your Model property you can do the following : 
   > protected $table = 'New Table name';
   > public $primaryKey = 'Your New Primary Key';
   > public $timeStamps = true/false;  - When set to true will automatically create a timeStamp fields (created_at,modified_at);

# Bringing your Model in the Controller :
  use App\ModelName;
  
  > You can then call your Model name using the ModelName::function();

# Fetching the Table data : 
  > ModelName::all(); - get all the data and will return an array 
  > ModelName::find($slug) - will get a specific data and return an array 
  > ModelName::orderBy('field','asc/desc')->get(); - will get all the table data and will order them by provided field and option. Take note that you must include the get clause
                                                   - for this query to run.
  > ModelName::orderBy('field','asc/desc')->take(count)->get() - will get all the table data and will order them by provided field and option.
                                                               - the take(count) clause is use to limit the return result 
                                                               - and most of all you must use the get() clause to get all the result 
  > ModelName::all()->paginate(count);  -   will paginate the return result 
  > {{ ->links() }} - will display a link ;

# If you want to use the SQL queries 
  use DB;
  DB::select('Your Query');
